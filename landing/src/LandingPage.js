                <h2>About ComplySync</h2>
                <p><i className="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
                ComplySync was born out of a conversation with a friend who shared the frustrations they faced with integrating company policies and keeping employees informed.  They, like many companies, were shelling out significant sums to online tools that handled these tasks inefficiently.  This was in april 2024 (we were both Holberton School students at the time!), and the idea sparked a fire within us.
                We envisioned a simpler, more cost-effective solution: a tool dedicated solely to notifying employees of new policies.  With that goal in mind, we embarked on a journey to define the project's requirements, the technologies needed, and the all-important Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  We meticulously crafted specifications, designed the architecture, built a data model, and outlined user stories â€“ all the building blocks necessary to bring ComplySync to life.
                This project is not just about creating a useful tool; it's a testament to the skills and knowledge we honed at Holberton School.  ComplySync serves as our Portfolio Project, a culmination of the problem-solving and development expertise we acquired during our time there.<i className="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
